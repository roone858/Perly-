**E-commerce Project Using Next.js, Prisma, and MongoDB**

## Introduction

This project is an e-commerce web application developed with Next.js for the frontend, Prisma for database access, and MongoDB as the database. It serves as a starting point for building your e-commerce website.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-e-commerce-project.git
   cd your-e-commerce-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configuration**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `.env.example`. Update your environment variables with your own configurations.

4. **Database Setup**

   - Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
   - Configure your database connection in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

     ```prisma
     generator client {
       provider = "prisma-client-js"
       output   = "./generated/client"
     }

     datasource db {
       provider = "mongodb"
       url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     }
     ```

5. **Migrate the Database**

   Run Prisma migrations to create the necessary tables in MongoDB:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

6. **Starting the Development Server**

   Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   Your e-commerce website should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
